## ðŸ‘· Building

Haskell Stack needs to be installed and on the path to install manually.


```sh
git clone https://github.com/sproott/pat.hs.git
cd pat.hs

mkdir bin
stack --local-bin-dir "bin/" install 

install -Dm755 "bin/paths-exe" "/usr/share/paths/paths-exe"
install -Dm755 "paths.sh" "/usr/share/paths/paths.sh"

install -Dm644 "doc/completions/bashcompletion.sh" "/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/paths"
```

Then add the following line to your .bashrc:

```sh
source /usr/share/paths/paths.sh
```

## ðŸ”§ Config file

- pat.hs stores the bookmarks in `$HOME/.paths-bookmarks`
- You can make direct edits to it, but if you break the format, the program will not launch until you fix it again

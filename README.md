## 👷 Building

Haskell Stack needs to be installed and on the path to install manually.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sproott/pat.hs.git
cd pat.hs

mkdir bin
stack --local-bin-path "bin/" install

sudo install -Dm755 "bin/paths" "/usr/share/paths/paths"
sudo install -Dm755 "bin/paths.sh" "/usr/share/paths/paths.sh"
sudo install -Dm755 "bin/paths.fish" "/usr/share/paths/paths.fish"
sudo install -Dm755 "bin/paths.zsh" "/usr/share/paths/paths.zsh"

sudo install -Dm644 "bin/completions/bashcompletion.sh" "/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/paths"
sudo install -Dm644 "bin/completions/fishcompletion.fish" "/usr/share/fish/completions/paths.fish"
sudo install -Dm644 "bin/completions/zshcompletion.zsh" "/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_paths"
```

## 🔧 Bookmarks file

- pat.hs stores the bookmarks in a `.bookmarks` file inside `$XDG_DATA_HOME/paths` or inside `$HOME/.local/share/paths`, if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is not defined
- You can make direct edits to it, but if you break the format, the program will not launch until you fix it again
